The equation you provided describes the total pressure-broadened linewidth (\( \gamma_{\text{total}} \)) of a spectral line in a gas mixture, taking into account both self-broadening and air-broadening effects. Let's break down the equation:

\[ \gamma_{\text{total}} = \text{VMR} \times \gamma_{\text{self}} + (1 - \text{VMR}) \times \gamma_{\text{air}} \]

Where:

- \( \gamma_{\text{total}} \): Total pressure-broadened linewidth in the gas mixture.
  
- \( \text{VMR} \): Volume Mixing Ratio of the target gas in the mixture. It represents the fraction (by volume) of the target gas in the mixture. For example, a VMR of 0.01 means the target gas constitutes 1% of the total gas mixture by volume.

- \( \gamma_{\text{self}} \): Self-broadened linewidth of the target gas. This parameter describes the broadening effect due to collisions between molecules of the same species (i.e., the target gas itself).

- \( \gamma_{\text{air}} \): Air-broadened linewidth of the target gas. This parameter describes the broadening effect due to collisions between molecules of the target gas and other constituents of air (e.g., N2, O2).

The equation essentially calculates a weighted average of the self-broadened and air-broadened linewidths based on the concentration (VMR) of the target gas in the mixture.

In practical applications, this equation is useful when analyzing gas samples that are not pure but are mixtures with air or other gases. By considering both self-broadening and air-broadening effects, one can achieve a more accurate representation of the spectral line shape in the mixture.
